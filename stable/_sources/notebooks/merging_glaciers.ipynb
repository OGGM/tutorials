    "OGGM initializes glaciers based on [RGI outlines](https://www.glims.org/RGI/) which allows for fully automated simulations starting from a recent global glacier state. OGGM also treats every glacier as entity which basically means that individual glaciers do not know about each other even if they are modelled within one specific run.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good approach for current and future simulations in a warming climate where we mainly expect glacier retreat. But if we want to look at colder climates, either from the past or in a synthetic way, we might have to adjust this glacier centric view and take the influence of neighbouring glaciers into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show how OGGM can merge several neighbouring glaciers into one coupled glacier system. The general approach for this is to view the surrounding glaciers in the same way as tributary [flowlines](https://docs.oggm.org/en/stable/flowlines.html) to an existing glacier entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**But before using this method please be aware of its limitations:** We are only able to merge glaciers which are present in the Randolph Glacier Inventory. This limits the time we can go back into the past as we are not able to *create* a glacier with OGGM at a place where there is no glacier today. The merging procedure was developed with typcial Alpine valley glaciers and their extensions around the Little Ice Age in mind. We did not develop this with glacial time scales in mind and [this statement about long term glacier evolution](https://docs.oggm.org/en/stable/faq.html#can-i-use-oggm-to-simulate-long-term-glacier-evolution) still holds up."
