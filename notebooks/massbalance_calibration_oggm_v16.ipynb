    "The default mass-balance (MB) model of OGGM is a very standard [temperature index melt model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169403002579). At the beginning, OGGM had a very complicated calibration procedure where the glaciers with in-situ data were calibrated and then a so-called *tstar* got interpolated for glaciers without observations (see the [original publication](https://www.the-cryosphere.net/6/1295/2012/tc-6-1295-2012.html)). This method was very powerful, however, as new observational datasets emerged, we can finally calibrate on a glacier-per-glacier basis. With the new era of geodetic observations, OGGM uses per default the average geodetic observations from Jan 2000--Jan 2020 of [Hugonnet al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03436-z), that are now available for almost every glacier world-wide. \n",

    "    - default is to calibrate the `melt_f`, and having the `prcp_fac` and `temp_bias` fixed. If the calibration does not work, the `temp_bias` is varied aswell. This is the option that is used operationally in OGGM in the preprocessed levels >=3 for all glaciers world-wide.\n",
    "    - you can also calibrate instead on `prcp_fac` or `temp_bias` and fix the other parameters.\n",
    "    - However, we showed that the parameter combination choice has an influence on other estimates than the average MB. The model parameter calibration choice can also impact future volume and runoff projections (see [Schuster et al., 2023, in review]()). \n",
    "- As user of OGGM, you will most likely just use the default calibration option. However, it is good to be aware of the overparameterisation problem. In addition, if you want to include uncertainties of the MB model calibration, you could include additional experiments that use another calibration option. With more available observational data or improved climate data, you might also be able to use better ways to calibrate the MB model parameters. \n"
