    "[The Randolph Glacier Inventory](https://www.glims.org/RGI/) is a key dataset to model glaciers at any scale: it includes outlines of the extent of each glacier in the world, an information that is critical in figuring out how much a particular glacier might contribute to rising sea level. These glacier outlines are the starting point of any simulation in OGGM. The RGI's latest version (v6), as well as v5, are provided and supported by OGGM (see the [documentation](https://oggm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input-data.html#glacier-outlines-and-intersects)). However, there are [several issues](https://rgitools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/known-issues.html) in the RGI that might make you want to use your own corrected glacier outlines. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes how to feed OGGM with them. We will show you three case studies about how to give any geometry to OGGM and avoid errors of incompatibility between your shapefile and the model framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have three case studies which should cover a number of applications:\n",
    "1. [Dividing a glacier into smaller entities](#case1) (common case, useful for poorly outlined glaciers, which are in reality separate dynamical entities)\n",
    "2. [Merging two glaciers together](#case2) (useful for tidewater glaciers in particular, not much elsewhere)\n",
