    "The default mass-balance model of OGGM is a very standard [temperature index melt model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169403002579). What's ... unusual about it, is the calibration procedure. We have explained it in quite some length in the [documentation](https://docs.oggm.org/en/stable/mass-balance.html), in [our paper](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/12/909/2019/), in the [original publication](https://www.the-cryosphere.net/6/1295/2012/tc-6-1295-2012.html) that introduced it for the first time, and we have created [a website](https://cluster.klima.uni-bremen.de/~oggm/ref_mb_params/oggm_v1.4/crossval.html) to monitor its performance. The method is not perfect (by far), but it is quite powerful: I've often said that it is the best idea that Ben ever had, and he has a lot of good ideas.\n",
